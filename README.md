# CCQ
App for CCQ to demonrate I can actually code. First attempt at using Vue.

Used Bootstrap for layout because it's easy.

**NOTE:** Does not work in IE - need to use Babel? Think it's probably the \<Template\>\</Template\> syntax.

TODO
---
* Added extra details into detail modal
* Move details modal into self contained component
* Add a filter/search in the header, thats why you put it there.


Task to complete
---

- Fetch json from API endpoint with authentication
- Display fetched json as a list in the DOM
- Have a way for a list item to be removed from the DOM. This could be actions on hover, swipe or a virtual wreaking ball, as long as there's a way to remove it.
- Must be responsive for desktop and mobile. Mobile dimensions we'll viewing the results on is 411x731 with a DPR of 2.6
